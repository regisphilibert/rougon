This is a simple open source website about [Les Rougon-Macquart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Rougon-Macquart) by [Emile Zola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Zola).

This well known french literature saga holds 20 books and more than a thousand characters.

Copying/pasting their bios in a WordPress before my coding days was kind of a lengthy hobby, but I ended with the perfect project to tryout new stuff!

After WordPress and AngularJS, I recently converted it to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) so I can play around with its new features.

That being said, I sincerly and passionately love **les Rougon Macquart**.

Every characters' entries are shamelessly copied from the incredible work of F.C. Ramond published in 1901.
